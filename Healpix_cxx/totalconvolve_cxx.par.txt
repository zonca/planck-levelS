Parameters read by totalconvolve_cxx:

fwhm_deconv (real, default=0):
  deconvolution FWHM in arc minutes.
  If the input map is smoothed, set fwhm_deconv to the FWHM of the smoothing
  beam, else set to 0.

polarisation (bool, default=true):
  whether the G and C components are also convolved and added to T

conv_lmax (integer):
  maximum l fo the convolution

lmax_out (integer, default=conv_lmax):
  used to determine the resolution of the generated ring set. It will have
  2*lmax_out+1 pixels in phi-direction.

beam_alm (string):
  input file containing the beam a_lm

beammmax (integer):
  maximum m of the beam

m_blocksize (integer, default=beammmax+1):
  the number of "m" values that are processed simultaneously.
  Increasing this (up to the maximum of beammmax+1) reduces CPU time,
  but increases required main memory.
  Decreasing it (down to te minimum of 1) slows down the code, but can
  significantly reduce memory usage.

sky_alm (string):
  input file containing the sky a_lm

ringset (string):
  output file name for the ring set
