Parameters read by almmixer:

focalplane_db (string):
  input file containing the detector database

detector_id (string):
  name of the detector

amx_nmaps (integer):
  number of maps to mix

amx_output_map (string):
  output file name for the mixed a_lm

amx_lmax (integer):
  maximum l of the output a_lm

amx_mmax (integer):
  maximum m of the output a_lm

amx_polar (bool):
  if true, polarised a_lm are created. Note that a_lm without polarisation
  information can still be used as input; they will only be mixed into the
  intensity a_lm set.

amx_response_type (string):
  shape of the detector response function
    DELTA : delta function at the detector frequency, with a magnitude of the
            detector bandwidth
    TOPHAT: tophat function from the minimum to the maximum frequency of the
            detector
    GAUSS : Gauss function centered at the detector frequency, with a sigma
            of the detector bandwidth

amx_monopole (bool, default=false):
  whether the CMB monopole should be included when a CMB map is present.

do x=1,amx_nmaps
  amx_mapname[x] (string):
    input alm file for component [x]

  amx_maptype[x] (string):
    type of the component [x]

                  will be added unchanged to the output map
