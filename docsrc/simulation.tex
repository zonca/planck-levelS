\section{Simulation Code}

\subsection{Obtaining the code}

The simulation packages reside in the IDIS CVS respository
at ESTEC. If you do not know how to get there, contact Martin Bremer
(\tw{mbremer@rssd.esa.int}) for \tw{<username>}
and the related password.

{\bf Note:} It is not recommended to copy a CVS file tree from someone else,
because CVS remembers the user who did the original checkout in the
{\tt */CVS/Root} files. That means that the user who copied the files
will not be able to update them or commit changes.

To do an initial checkout of the LevelS sources you should issue the
following commands:
 \begin{verbatim}
 setenv CVSROOT :pserver:<username>@cvs.rssd.esa.int:/services/repositories/PLANCK_CVS
 (or export CVSROOT=:pserver:<username>@cvs.rssd.esa.int:/services/repositories/PLANCK_CVS)
 cvs login
 cvs co -P planck/LevelS
 \end{verbatim}

Please note that the local directory {\tt planck/LevelS} should not exist
before the checkout.

\subsection{Updating your version of the code}

To update your copy of the source code, enter the directory \tw{planck/LevelS}
and issue the command
\begin{verbatim}
cvs -q update -Pd
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Compilation}

In order to compile the code you will need following programs:
\begin{itemize}
   \item an up-to-date version of \tw{GNU make}. Parallel compilation is
     supported for \tw{GNU make} 3.79 and later.
   \item a \tw{C} compiler supporting the C90 standard.
   \item a \tw{C++} compiler supporting the C++98 standard; this includes
     \tw{g++} 3.0 and above and the compilers of SGI and IBM.
   \item a Fortran 95 compiler with support for the Fortran 2003 module
     \tw{iso\_c\_binding}. This includes \tw{GNU gfortran} 4.3 and above as well
     as Intel \tw{ifort} 10.0 and above.
\end{itemize}
To compile the code, follow the instructions
in \tw{planck/LevelS/README.compilation}.

Note: in order to make use of hybrid C++/Fortran modules, it is required that
the employed C++ and Fortran compilers come from the same ``vendor'', like
\tw{g++/gfortran} or \tw{icpc/ifort}.

\section{Test Pipeline}

\begin{itemize}

\item To run the simulation, you will need the following items:
   \begin{itemize}
   \item Template maps and beam patterns. \\
      In order to keep code and data separate, there are no template maps,
      spectra or beam patterns included in the package.
      An archive file containing all the data necessary for the test
      pipeline can be downloaded from MPA's Planck web pages at\\
      \href{http://planck.MPA-Garching.MPG.DE/SimData/test/testdata.tar.gz}
        {http://planck.MPA-Garching.MPG.DE/SimData/test/testdata.tar.gz}.
   \item \tw{xv} \\
      The image viewer \tw{xv} is used only for displaying some
      results. It is thus not strictly required.
      If you prefer another image viewer, you can enter its name when
      \tw{SetupSimulation} asks for it.
   \end{itemize}

\item Run the setup script \tw{planck/LevelS/SetupSimulation}.
It will ask for the path containing the template data and module binaries,
the name of your image viewer and several other simulation-specific
parameters which are explained in chapter \ref{simparam}.

\item The script creates the parameter files necessary for running the test
pipeline and tells you how to start the simulation.

If everything worked fine, the image viewer will show you
the results of your test run. You can compare them with our sample run
available on our web pages at\\
\href{http://planck.MPA-Garching.MPG.DE/SimData/index_test.html}
{http://planck.MPA-Garching.MPG.DE/SimData/index\_test.html}.

\item Be aware that the \tw{Pipeline} script only offers
a way for testing your self-compiled simulation packages and
is thus only a very specialized simulation. If you want to produce
\emph{real} data, you need to set the parameters of each step carefully
according to the requirements of the simulation you want to run.

\end{itemize}

\section{Simulation parameters}
\label{simparam}

\begin{itemize}

\item \tw{NSIDE}

The resolution of the output maps produced by the pipeline
(i.e.~the \tw{HEALPix NSIDE} parameter).
It has to be a power of 2 and should lie between 16 and 512.

The sky is tesselated into $12\,N_\mathrm{side}^2$ pixels. This implies
that the approximate side length of a HEALPix pixel is
$$
  \delta\theta\approx\sqrt{\frac{3}{\pi}}\,
  \frac{3600}{N_\mathrm{side}}\;\hbox{arc minutes}\;.
$$
This gives a clue for the choice of $N_\mathrm{side}$ required by
your simulation.

\item \tw{LMAX}

This quantity determines how accurately the ``synthetic skies'' are
calculated, which are scanned by the detector later on.
The \tw{LMAX} parameter should be twice to three times the value chosen
for \tw{NSIDE}, up to a maximum of 2900. Note that the foreground maps
distributed in \tw{testdata.tar.gz} only contain $a_{lm}$ up to
$l_{\mathrm{max}}=1024$, so that a higher $l$ will not further improve the
quality of the foreground signal.

\item Detector name

Depending on this, all characteristic quantities like detector frequency,
sampling frequency, bandwidth, noise amplitudes, orientation relative to
the optical axis etc.\ are determined from the focal plane database.
If a simulation with special parameters is required, an additional detector
with the desired parameters has to be added by hand to the database.

\item First and last pointing period of the mission

These parameters influence the sky coverage of the simulation and also the
size of the output files. If unsure, leave them at the default of -1, which
means that all pointing periods available in the input PPL file will be used.

\item Nominal vs.\ realistic pointing

If realistic pointing is chosen, detailed pointing information with
synthesised pointing errors is created for each pointing period, and
the sky is scanned 60 times instead of once per period.
This will increase the overall running time by roughly a factor of 60
and also require more storage space for intermediate data.

\end{itemize}
