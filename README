This branch of the repository contains the Planck Simulation
Package. It is subdivided into the following main sub-packages:

 - libcfitsio:
   external library required for FITS file access
   (see http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/)

 - c_utils, libfftpack and libsharp:
   C libraries required by other LevelS components

 - cxxsupport: miscellaneous C++ utility functions needed by the C++ codes

 - Healpix_cxx: software package implementing the Hierarchical Equal-Area
   equi-Lateral Pixelisation scheme

 - skymixer2: extrapolation and combination of foreground components

 - cxxmod: C++ modules simulating various effects needed by multimod

 - pntsrcconvolver: C++ point source convolution code, used by multimod

 - multimod: C++ code for production of Planck data time streams

 - cxxtools: package containing several convenient standalone modules

 - portability: non-standard extensions needed by Fortran codes

 - Modules: common Fortran modules used by more than one of the simulation
   packages

 - CAMB: code for computing CMB power spectra
   Main author: Antony Lewis (antony <at> cosmologist <dot> info)

 - Beam: Codes for creation and manipulation of beam patterns
   Main author: Mark Ashdown (maja1 <at> mrao.cam<dot>ac.uk)

 - simmission3/4: Code for simulating the satellite dynamics
   Main author: Daniel Mortlock (d _dot_ mortlock<at>imperial.ac.uk)

 - zlelib: library for computing zodiacal light emission
   Main author: Michele Maris (maris(at)oats.inaf(dot)it)

 - LFI-specific: Code used by the Low-Frequency Instrument only
   Main author: Davide Maino (davide(dot)maino_at_mi.infn.it)

 - conviqt: latest incarnation of the total convolution algorithm
   Main author: Gary Prezeau (Gary.Prezeau_at_jpl.nasa.gov)

In addition:

 - SetupSimulation allows to choose simulation parameters.

Finally, the directory "etc" contains template and default parameter files.
