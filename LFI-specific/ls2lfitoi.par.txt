Parameters read by ls2lfitoi:

therm_sky_file (string, default="")
 if not empty Sky thermal fluctuations TOD is read

therm_load_file (string, default="")
 if not empty Load thermal fluctuations TOD is read

fspike_file (string, default="")
 if not empty frequency spikes TOD is read

time_file (string, default="")
 if not empty toi.LS_TimeTOD object with time stamp is read

telescope_file (string, default="")
  if not empty toi.LS_toi with fluctuations of telescope temperature
  sampled at the right detector sampling frequency are read

tref_temp (double, default=4.5):
 reference load radiometric temperature (in K). In the current
 implementation it is assumed to be constant. Usually around 4.5 K
 this is the zero level for the load fluctuations. Be sure to
 input here the proper zero level if it is different.

t_telescope (double, default=42):
  reference telescope temperature in K.

emissivity (double, default=1):
  emissivity of the telescope.

has_monopole (bool):
   boolean variable to determines whether input simulated signal
   toi contains the CMB monopole

detector_id (string):
  detector identifier (e.g. LFI-28S)

tsky (string):
  toi as output from multimod (expected toi.LS_toi) with ONLY signal

tsky_noise (string):
  toi with pure white noise with the expected value of instrument sensitivity

tref_noise (string):
  another independent toi with pure white noise with the
  expected value of instrument sensitivity

oof_noise (string):
  toi with pure 1/f noise with properties expected in the
  differenced (i.e. T_sky - R * T_load) data

oof_noise_tp (string):
  toi with pure 1/f noise with properties expected in the
  Total Power (un-differenced) data. Usually knee-frequency
  is around few x 10 Hz

file_toi (string):
  output toi.science.LFI_Data with correct data structure

focalplane_db (string):
  location of the instrument database

verbosity (bool, default=false):
  enable verbose messages to the console?
