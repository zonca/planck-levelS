Parameters read by quantum:

fnamein (string):
  input toi.science.LFI_Data (un-differenced data) in ADU to be quantized

fnameout (string):
  output toi.science.LFI_Data (un-differenced data) in ADU after quantization
  and reconstruction has been performed

n_aver (int, default=1):
  number of average of samples. If data come from LevelS or from TMH 
  (LFI-L1) use default value

offset (float):
  offset to be applied to differenced data (with gmf1 and gmf2)

quant (float):
  quantization factor (in units of sigma of white noise)

gmf1 (float):
  On-board value of gain modulation factor to produce differenced
  data to satisfy band-width constraints

gmf2 (float):
  The other on-board value of gain modulation factor to
  produce differenced data.
