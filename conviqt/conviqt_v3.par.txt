Parameters read by conviqt_v3:

fwhm_deconv (real, default=0):
  deconvolution FWHM in arc minutes.
  If the input map is smoothed, set fwhm_deconv to the FWHM of the smoothing
  beam, else set to 0.

polarisation (bool, default=true):
  whether the G and C components are also convolved and added to T

conv_lmax (integer):
  maximum l fo the convolution

lmax_out (integer, default=conv_lmax):
  used to determine the resolution of the generated ring set. It will have
  2*lmax_out+1 pixels in phi-direction.

nphi (integer, default=2*lmax_out+1):
  used to determine the resolution of the generated ring set. It will have
  nphi pixels in phi-direction.

ntheta (integer, default=lmax_out+2):
  used to determine the theta resolution of the generated ring set. It will have
  ntheta rings in theta-direction (including theta=0 and theta=pi).
  (NB: additional rings will be automatically computed for interpolation
  purposes.)

beam_alm (string):
  input file containing the beam a_lm

beammmax (integer):
  maximum m of the beam

sky_alm (string):
  input file containing the sky a_lm

ringset (string):
  output file name for the ring set
